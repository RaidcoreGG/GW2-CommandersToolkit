# GW2-CommandersToolkit
Commander's Toolkit provides a variety of tools for party and squad management.

## Features
- Keep track of players leaving the squad. (Automatically purged after 5 minutes.)
- Keep track of Quickness, Alacrity and Damage Type (Power, Condition, Heal) of group members.
- Set KP Requirements and automatically check, if group members fulfill it.
- Displays a warning if more than 5 members per subgroup. (Boon/Heal distribution.)
- Field for taking notes, for extra information.

## Requirements
Requires [RealTime API](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-RealTime-API-Releases) or [ArcDPS](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-RealTime-API-Releases) with [Unofficial Extras](https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_unofficial_extras_releases) optionally.  
Both RealTime API and Unofficial Extras automatically and more accurately detect subgroups and player joins/leaves.

### Limitations
With just ArcDPS subgroups have to be managed manually, or are updated on combat enter or instance change.

## Installation
Install via the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) Addon Library or download the latest `commanderstoolkit.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-CommandersToolkit/releases) and place in `<Guild Wars 2>/addons`
