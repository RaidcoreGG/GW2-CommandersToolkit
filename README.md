# GW2-CommandersToolkit
A simple addon that lets you keep track of who's responsible for which job.
If someone leaves the group, you see at a glance what's missing.

If everything in a subgroup is covered, the text will be in green. If you have more than 5 members in a sub, you will be shown a warning.

When a user goes out of scope (leaves instance or squad), they will be shown in red and you can click to remove them. Once they go into scope again, they will no longer be marked.

## Requirements
Requires [RealTime API](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-RealTime-API-Releases) or [ArcDPS](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-RealTime-API-Releases) with [Unofficial Extras](https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_unofficial_extras_releases) optionally.  
Both RealTime API and Unofficial Extras automatically and more accurately detect subgroups and player joins/leaves.

### Limitations
With just ArcDPS subgroups have to be managed manually, or are updated on combat enter or instance change.

## Installation
Install via the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) Addon Library or download the latest `commanderstoolkit.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-CommandersToolkit/releases) and place in `<Guild Wars 2>/addons`
